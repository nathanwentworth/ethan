# Ethan's Website Wants - FINAL
7/24/17

- Jekyll plz, so I can learn it and use it and it's flexible and stuff
- **Writerly**, Smart, with a hint of **fun**
- *Excellent* tyopography!
    + Header should be HEAVY, distinct, serif?
        * Arvo? 
        * Zilla Slab?
        * Raleway?
        * Okygen?
    + Body should be easy to read and simple, sans-serif
        * Open Source Sans?
        * Open Sans?
        * Lato?
- Lightweight / easy on the eyes
- Color accents that are purple/Indigo or navy blue
- Some hints of fancy web design flourishes?
    - Fancy underlines? (The kind that skip serifs hanging below line?)
    - Background image pattern or interesting texture?

**Website Structure:**

## Home
**Header**
    - Name 
    - Byline (Producer and Writer)
    - Links to **Interactive**, **Writing**, **About**
    - Social Media Icons for Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn

**Featured Works**
    2-3 items with image, 1-3 sentence blurb, link
    (I'll usually use this for works, but I could also use it for news links or something in the future)

**Mini About**
    - Picture
    - Short blurb that I'll write with more info about me, leads to full about page

## Interactive
- Grid of Interactive Projects
- Sections by Year
- Per project:
    * Image (all 3:2 aspect?)
    * Title
    * Year
    * Role(s)
    * Slugline (1 sentence)
        - I'll write these, just give me space!
        - OR do these clutter things up? Would love to hear your thoughts!

## Writing
- This will just be a list of links to writing I've done! I can obviously deal with the content, but really what I need is attractive looking type with bullet lists looking nice somehow!
- (Up to you whether or not there are actually bullets)
- Use headings to separate sections (by year, later in life maybe publication)

## About
- Pseudo-resume layout, aka sections with horizontal lines between
    * Picture (circular?)
    * Bio paragraph
    * Experience
    * Volunteer
    * Education
    * Skills
